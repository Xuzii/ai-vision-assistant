- ‚úÖ Camera streaming (MJPEG)
- ‚úÖ Token and cost tracking (per activity)
- ‚úÖ YOLOv8 person detection
- ‚úÖ Basic statistics API (total activities, by room, by camera)

### Frontend (New)
- Complete React/TypeScript application with Vite
- Modern UI with Motion animations and Radix UI components
- 6 main tabs: Analytics, Timeline, Tracking, Objects, Voice, System
- Comprehensive dashboard with many advanced features

---

## Missing Backend Features

### 1. Activity Categorization System ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Frontend Expects:** Activities categorized as:
- Productivity (üíº Working, typing, meetings)
- Health (üí™ Exercise, yoga, running)
- Entertainment (üéÆ TV, games, movies)
- Social (üë• Conversations, meals together)
- Other (üìå General activities)

**Current Backend:** No categorization exists

**Implementation Needed:**
- Add `category` column to activities table (VARCHAR: Productivity/Health/Entertainment/Social/Other)
- Update activity_detector.py to use GPT-4o-mini to categorize activities
- Enhance the OpenAI prompt to return structured JSON with category
- Update dashboard.py API endpoints to include category in responses

**Database Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN category TEXT;
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN category_confidence REAL;
```

---

### 2. Person Tracking & Identification ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Frontend Expects:** Named persons (e.g., "John", "Sarah", "Both")
- Activities attributed to specific people
- Person presence in rooms
- "Who is doing what" tracking

**Current Backend:** Only detects "person present" vs "no person"

**Implementation Needed:**
- Face recognition system OR manual tagging system
- New `persons` table in database
- Update activities table with `person_id` or `person_name`
- API endpoint to manage persons: `/api/persons` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Update camera_manager to identify persons

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE persons (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    face_encoding BLOB,  -- For face recognition
    created_at TEXT,
    is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN person_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN person_id INTEGER;
```

**Recommendation:** Start with manual tagging (user clicks activity and assigns person), add face recognition later

---

### 3. Object Tracking System ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:** Track important household items:
- MacBook Pro, iPhone, Car Keys, Wallet, etc.
- Last seen location and time
- Present/Missing status
- Confidence score

**Current Backend:** No object tracking at all

**Implementation Needed:**
- New `tracked_objects` table
- YOLOv8 object detection (already available, just need to use it)
- Object tracking logic in camera_manager.py
- API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/objects` - List all tracked objects
  - `POST /api/objects` - Add object to track
  - `PUT /api/objects/<id>` - Update object
  - `DELETE /api/objects/<id>` - Remove from tracking
  - `GET /api/objects/<id>/history` - Location history

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE tracked_objects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,  -- Electronics, Personal, Appliances, Furniture
    last_seen_location TEXT,
    last_seen_timestamp TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    status TEXT,  -- present, missing
    image_path TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE object_detections (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    object_id INTEGER,
    camera_name TEXT,
    room TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    bbox_x INTEGER,
    bbox_y INTEGER,
    bbox_width INTEGER,
    bbox_height INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (object_id) REFERENCES tracked_objects(id)
);
```

---

### 4. Voice Query System ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:**
- Voice input for queries
- Text OR voice output
- Queries like: "What was I doing at 2 PM?", "How much time on productivity today?"

**Current Backend:** Basic voice_assistant.py exists but not integrated with API

**Implementation Needed:**
- `/api/voice/transcribe` - POST endpoint for audio transcription (Whisper)
- `/api/voice/query` - POST endpoint for natural language queries
- `/api/voice/synthesize` - POST endpoint for text-to-speech (optional)
- GPT-4o-mini to interpret queries and query database
- Integration with existing voice_assistant.py

**API Design:**
```json
POST /api/voice/transcribe
{
  "audio": "base64_encoded_audio"
}
Response: { "text": "What was I doing at 2 PM?" }

POST /api/voice/query
{
  "query": "What was I doing at 2 PM?"
}
Response: {
  "answer": "You were in the Living Room working on your laptop.",
  "activities": [...],
  "tokens_used": 150,
  "cost": 0.0003
}
```

- `/api/processes/<id>/restart` - POST restart process
- `/api/processes/<id>/start` - POST start process
- `/api/processes/<id>/stop` - POST stop process
- Integration with system process manager or subprocess module

**Note:** This is complex and may require running Flask with elevated permissions or using systemd/supervisor

---

### 6. Enhanced Cost Monitoring ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:**
- Daily spent amount vs daily cap
- Total tokens used today
- Requests count today
- Cost breakdown by category

**Current Backend:** Basic cost tracking per activity exists

CREATE TABLE cost_settings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    daily_cap REAL DEFAULT 2.00,
    notification_threshold REAL DEFAULT 1.50,
    updated_at TEXT
);
```

---

### 7. Room Mapping & Floor Plans ‚≠ê LOW PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:**
- Visual room map
- Object count per room

- Person, location, activity, category

**Current Backend:** Activities have timestamps but no duration

**Implementation Needed:**
- Add `duration_minutes` to activities table
- Logic to calculate duration (time between same-person activities in same location)
- `/api/timeline` - GET timeline for specific date
- Query parameter: `date=2025-10-22`

**Database Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN duration_minutes INTEGER;
```

---

### 9. Today Overview & Streaks ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:**
- Desk time today (how long at desk)
- Unique activities count
- Percent change from yesterday
- Streak (consecutive days of activity)
- Category breakdown percentages

**Current Backend:** None of this exists

**Implementation Needed:**
- `/api/overview/today` - GET today's overview
- Streak calculation logic (count consecutive days with activities)
- Category percentage calculations
- "Desk" location detection (specific room or activity)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_streaks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_activity_date TEXT
);
```

---

### 10. Enhanced Analytics ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Frontend Expects:**
- 7-day stacked bar chart (categories per day)
- Hourly chart for today (categories by hour)
- Pie chart of category distribution
- Peak activity hours

**Current Backend:** Basic statistics only

**Implementation Needed:**
- `/api/analytics/weekly` - GET 7-day data with category breakdown
- `/api/analytics/daily` - GET hourly breakdown for today
- `/api/analytics/peak-hours` - GET most active time periods
- Complex aggregation queries

**Example Response:**

  "room": "Living Room",
  "activity": "Person detected",
  "details": "1 person present",
  "cost": 0.0025,
  "tokens_used": 150
}
```

### Required Activity Data Format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T14:30:00",
  "person": "John",  // NEW
  "location": "Living Room",
  "activity": "Working on laptop, typing actively",  // More descriptive

1. Start with Phase 1 critical features
2. Implement each feature sequentially
3. Test thoroughly before moving to next phase

### Option B: Mock Data Mode
1. Integrate frontend immediately
2. Keep using mock data from App.tsx
3. Gradually replace mock data with real API calls
4. Good for visual testing while backend is being built

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
1. Integrate frontend with existing API endpoints
2. Use mock data for missing features
3. Implement backend features one by one
4. Replace mock data as features become available

## Conclusion

The new frontend is extremely comprehensive and well-designed, but requires significant backend development to support all features. The current backend provides a solid foundation (authentication, basic activity tracking, camera streaming), but needs:

1. **Activity categorization** - Most critical missing piece
2. **Person identification** - Essential for "who is doing what"
3. **Duration tracking** - Needed for timelines and "desk time"
4. **Enhanced analytics** - Category breakdowns and charts
5. **Object tracking** - Separate feature system
6. **Voice queries** - Natural language interface
7. **Many smaller features** - Streaks, cost monitoring, settings, etc.

Recommend starting with **Option C (Hybrid Approach)** to get the frontend running quickly while systematically building out backend features.
