# Implementation Summary - Partially Implemented Features

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ✅ Completed

This document summarizes the full implementation of the partially completed features from the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md.

---

## Overview

The following features were **partially implemented** and have now been **fully implemented**:

1. ✅ Database Schema Changes
2. ✅ Enhanced Cost Monitoring
3. ✅ Camera Connection Status Tracking
4. ✅ Voice Query System (Natural Language)

---

## 1. Database Schema Changes

### What Was Missing
- 8 database tables were not created (persons, tracked_objects, object_detections, camera_status, cost_settings, user_settings, user_streaks, voice_queries)

### Implementation
**File Modified:** `src/core/database_setup.py`

**Tables Added (automatically created):**
- `persons` - Person tracking and identification
- `tracked_objects` - Object tracking system
- `object_detections` - Object detection history
- `camera_status` - Camera connection status tracking
- `cost_settings` - Daily cost caps and thresholds
- `user_settings` - User preferences
- `user_streaks` - Activity streak tracking
- `voice_queries` - Voice query history

**How It Works:**
All tables are now created automatically when `setup_database()` runs. No separate migration step needed.

**Result:** All 14 tables now exist in the database (up from 6 tables).

---

## 2. Enhanced Cost Monitoring

### What Was Missing
- No `cost_settings` table
- No API endpoints for cost monitoring
- Cost tracking was only in-memory in camera_manager

### Implementation
**File Modified:** `src/web/dashboard.py`
**File Modified:** `src/core/camera_manager.py`

**New API Endpoints:**

#### GET `/api/cost/today`
Get today's cost metrics including daily spend, cap, and category breakdown.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "daily_spent": 0.1250,
  "daily_cap": 2.00,
  "total_tokens": 8500,
  "requests_today": 45,
  "percentage_used": 6.3,
  "threshold_reached": false,
  "cap_reached": false,
  "by_category": [
    {"category": "Productivity", "cost": 0.0500, "tokens": 3200},
    {"category": "Health", "cost": 0.0300, "tokens": 2100}
  ]
}
```

#### GET `/api/cost/settings`
Get current cost settings (daily cap and notification threshold).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "daily_cap": 2.00,
  "notification_threshold": 1.50,
  "last_reset_date": "2025-10-23"
}
```

#### PUT `/api/cost/settings`
Update cost settings.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "daily_cap": 3.00,
  "notification_threshold": 2.00
}
```

#### GET `/api/cost/history`
Get cost history for the last 30 days.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "history": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-23",
      "total_cost": 0.1250,
      "total_tokens": 8500,
      "total_requests": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

**Camera Manager Changes:**
- `check_daily_cost_limit()` now reads from database instead of instance variables
- Daily cost cap is enforced from `cost_settings` table
- Automatic reset on new day

---

## 3. Camera Connection Status Tracking

### What Was Missing
- No `camera_status` table
- No API endpoints for camera status
- Camera connection failures not tracked in database

### Implementation
**File Modified:** `src/web/dashboard.py`
**File Modified:** `src/core/camera_manager.py`

**New API Endpoints:**

#### GET `/api/cameras/status`
Get real-time status of all configured cameras.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "cameras": [
    {
      "id": "living_room_camera",
      "name": "Living Room Camera",
      "location": "Living Room",
      "is_connected": true,
      "last_successful_connection": "2025-10-23T14:30:00",
      "last_failed_connection": null,
      "consecutive_failures": 0,
      "error_message": null
    },
    {
      "id": "kitchen_camera",
      "name": "Kitchen Camera",
      "location": "Kitchen",
      "is_connected": false,
      "last_successful_connection": "2025-10-23T12:00:00",
      "last_failed_connection": "2025-10-23T14:35:00",
      "consecutive_failures": 3,
      "error_message": "Cannot connect to camera"
    }
  ],
  "failed_count": 1,
  "total_count": 2
}
```

#### POST `/api/cameras/<camera_name>/reconnect`
Trigger a reconnection attempt for a specific camera (resets failure count).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reconnection triggered"
}
```

**Camera Manager Changes:**
- New method `update_camera_status()` tracks connection success/failure
- Called automatically in `capture_frame()` method
- Records consecutive failures and error messages
- Tracks last successful and failed connection times

---

## 4. Voice Query System (Natural Language)

### What Was Missing
- No natural language query handler for activity history
- Existing `voice_assistant.py` only handled voice queries with live camera view
- No query history tracking

### Implementation
**File Modified:** `src/web/dashboard.py`

**New API Endpoints:**

#### POST `/api/voice/query`
Process natural language query about activities using GPT-4o-mini.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "query": "What was I doing at 2 PM today?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "answer": "At 2:00 PM today, you were in the home office working on your laptop. This was categorized as a Productivity activity and lasted for approximately 45 minutes.",
  "tokens_used": 1250,
  "cost": 0.000375,
  "execution_time_ms": 850
}
```

**Features:**
- Queries last 50 activities for context
- Includes category summaries for today
- Tracks all queries in `voice_queries` table
- Records tokens used, cost, and execution time

#### GET `/api/voice/history`
Get voice query history for the current user.

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` (integer, default: 20) - Number of queries to return

**Response:**
```json
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "user_id": 1,
      "query_text": "What was I doing at 2 PM today?",
      "response_text": "At 2:00 PM today...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:30:00",
      "tokens_used": 1250,
      "cost": 0.000375,
      "execution_time_ms": 850
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Database Schema (19 tests)
2. Configuration Files (3 tests)
3. Core Modules (6 tests)
4. API Server (9 tests)
5. Activity Categorization (5 tests)
6. Duration Tracking (2 tests)
7. Camera Status Tracking (5 tests)
8. Cost Monitoring (6 tests)
9. Voice Query System (5 tests)
10. Person Tracking (5 tests)
11. Object Tracking (8 tests)
12. Authentication & Security (5 tests)

✅ Camera connection status tracking with detailed error reporting
✅ Natural language voice query system for activity analysis

All implementations follow the specifications in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and are production-ready.
